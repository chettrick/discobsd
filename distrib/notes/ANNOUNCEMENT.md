--- DiscoBSD 2.0 RELEASED ---

December 31, 2022

DiscoBSD 2.0 is released.

This is the first official release of DiscoBSD, the multi-platform
2.11BSD-based operating system for microcontrollers.

In addition to the PIC32MX7 support in DiscoBSD/pic32 (inherited from
RetroBSD), the release of DiscoBSD 2.0 supports the Arm Cortex-M4-based
STM32F4 family of microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics in the new
DiscoBSD/stm32 port.

DiscoBSD is a descendant of 2.11BSD and inherits its strong BSD heritage.
The userland is powerful, full-featured, and comfortable to any competent
UNIX user, as it is derived from the rich 4.3BSD-Tahoe userland.

Install, build, and debug instructions can be found in the README files.
