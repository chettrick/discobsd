## Build

A few packages are required to compile everything from source.
Under Ubuntu installation can be done by the commands:

```sh
$ apt install bison byacc flex git groff-base libbsd-dev
$ apt install libelf-dev libfuse-dev sudo unzip zip
```
If a mips-elf-gcc compiler package is not available from the host distribution,
then the compiler toolchain must be built following [these instructions][19].

[19]: https://web.archive.org/web/20200126100825/http://retrobsd.org/wiki/doku.php/doc/toolchain-mips

The desired filesystem size and swap area size can be changed, as required.
Default is:
```Makefile
FS_MBYTES   = 200
U_MBYTES    = 200
SWAP_MBYTES = 2
```
To compile the kernel and build a filesystem image, run:

```sh
$ make MACHINE=pic32 MACHINE_ARCH=mips distribution
```

A resulting root filesystem image is in the file `sdcard.img`.
Kernel files are named `unix.hex` and are in target board subdirectories.

### Filesystem image

The file system image `sdcard.img` needs to be imaged onto an SD card.

On Windows host systems use a disk imaging utility such as [Rufus][20].

On Unix-like host systems with `dd` run:
```sh
$ dd bs=1M if=sdcard.img of=/path/to/SD/card
```

The target `installfs` can be used to image the SD card on Unix-like systems.
Provide the path to the SD card via the command line:
```sh
$ make MACHINE=pic32 SDCARD=/path/to/SD/card installfs
```

### Install kernel

The kernel image must be written to the PIC32 flash memory.
The specific procedure depends on the target development board.

#### PIC32-RETROBSD board:
Use the [pic32prog][21] utility and a USB cable to install the kernel:

```sh
$ pic32prog sys/arch/pic32/compile/PINGUINO_MICRO/unix.hex
```

#### Max32 board:
Use the [pic32prog][21] utility and a USB cable to install the kernel:

```sh
$ pic32prog -d /dev/ttyUSB0 sys/arch/pic32/compile/MAX32/unix.hex
```

#### UBW32 board:
Use the [pic32prog][21] utility and a USB cable to install the kernel:

```sh
$ pic32prog sys/arch/pic32/compile/UBW32/unix.hex
```

#### Maximite:
Use the bootload program for Windows, download links are available here:
https://geoffg.net/MonoMaximite.html#Downloads

#### Explorer 16 board:
There is an auxiliary PIC18 chip on the Explorer 16 board, which can be
used as a built-in programmer device.  A PICkit 2 adapter is needed to
install the required firmware, as described in [this article][22] in the
section "Hack #2: Lose the PICkit 2, Save $35".
This should be done only once.

Then, use the [pic32prog][21] utility and a USB cable to install the kernel:

``` sh
$ pic32prog sys/arch/pic32/compile/EXPLORER16/unix.hex
```

#### PIC32 Starter Kit:
Use the PICkit 2 adapter and software to install a boot loader from the file
[starter-kit/bootloader.hex][23] in the [pic32-usb-bootloader][24] repository.
This should be done only once.

Then, use the [pic32prog][21] utility and a USB cable to install the kernel:

```sh
$ pic32prog sys/arch/pic32/compile/STARTER_KIT/unix.hex
```

## Simulator

Use the VirtualMIPS MIPS32 simulator to develop and debug DiscoBSD/pic32
without the need for a hardware development board.
By default, the simulator is configured to imitate a Max32 board.
To build it:

```sh
$ cd tools/virtualmips
$ make
```

Run it:

```sh
$ ./pic32
```

Configuration of the simulated board is stored in the file `pic32_max32.conf`.
