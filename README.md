DiscoBSD
========

2.11BSD-based UNIX-like Operating System for STM32 and PIC32 Microcontrollers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DiscoBSD is a 2.11BSD-based UNIX-like operating system for microcontrollers,
with a focus on high portability to memory constrained devices without a
memory management unit.

The current and sixth official release of DiscoBSD is [DiscoBSD 2.5][1],
released on August 11, 2025.

This microcontroller-focused operating system is an independent continuation
of RetroBSD, a 2.11BSD-based OS targeting the MIPS-based PIC32MX7.
DiscoBSD is multi-platform, as it also supports Arm Cortex-M4 STM32F4 devices.

Source code to the system is freely available under a BSD-like license.

History
-------

[DiscoBSD][2] began as an undergraduate [Directed Study][3] in the winter of
2020 at the University of Victoria, Canada, as a case study of [RetroBSD][4]
to port the operating system to the Arm Cortex-M4 architecture, and to enable
portability in the hosting environment and target architectures and platforms.
The paper [*Porting the Unix Kernel*][5] details this initial porting effort.

Work on DiscoBSD has progressed in earnest since the completion of the
Directed Study, with the DiscoBSD/stm32 port booting multi-user in
August 2022. The system is quite usable on supported development boards.

And work continues...

DiscoBSD Resource Requirements
------------------------------

A basic, minimal system uses 128 Kbytes of flash and 128 Kbytes of RAM.

The kernel is loaded into the flash and only uses 32 Kbytes of RAM.
User programs each use the remaining 96 Kbytes of RAM, via swapping.
Devices with more RAM can be used to run larger user programs.

An SD card, at least 512 Mbytes in size, is required for the root file system.

Installing and Running
----------------------

Installation consists of loading the kernel into the microcontroller's flash
memory, and imaging the SD card with the file `sdcard.img`.

On Windows host systems use a disk imaging utility such as [Rufus][6].

On Unix-like host systems with `dd` run:

    $ dd bs=1M if=sdcard.img of=/path/to/SD/card

The board-specific kernel `unix` must be loaded into the MCU's flash memory.
Formats are ELF `unix.elf`, binary `unix.bin`, and Intel HEX `unix.hex`.

Flashing a DiscoBSD/stm32 kernel firmware into target board's flash memory:

On Windows host systems use [STM32CubeProgrammer][7] for flash programming.

On Unix-like host systems use `st-flash` from the [stlink-org project][8] to
load the binary-formatted kernel `unix.bin` into flash memory at 0x08000000.

    $ st-flash --reset write unix.bin 0x08000000

Flashing a DiscoBSD/pic32 kernel firmware into target board's flash memory:

On all supported host systems use [pic32prog][9] for flash programming.

    $ pic32prog unix.hex

Communication with the DiscoBSD console requires a serial port. A USB to TTL
device or the built-in VCP USB serial port on development boards can be used.

    $ cu -l /dev/cuaU0 -s 115200

Depending on the host system, other serial port utilities such as `screen`,
`minicom`, `putty`, or `teraterm` may be used.

Log in to DiscoBSD with user `root` and a blank password.
Shutdown DiscoBSD with the `halt`, `shutdown`, or `reboot` commands.

Manual pages on DiscoBSD are available through the `man` command.

Building
--------

DiscoBSD is cross-built on UNIX-like host operating systems.

Currently supported host operating systems: OpenBSD, Linux, FreeBSD.

Instructions to configure an OpenBSD host development environment for
Arm and MIPS targets is [available here][10].

The build system fully supports both BSD make and GNU make.

From the source tree root, run:

    $ make build

or just:

    $ make

which builds `sys/arch/stm32/compile/${BOARD}/unix` ELF-formatted kernels
and builds and populates a whole file system userland in `DESTDIR`.

Running:

    $ make distribution

will build everything from a `make build`, plus generate a file system
image in the file `distrib/stm32/sdcard.img` for imaging to an SD card.

DiscoBSD/stm32 is the default port, but DiscoBSD/pic32 may be built via:

    $ make clean
    $ make MACHINE=pic32 MACHINE_ARCH=mips distribution

to generate a file system image in the file `distrib/pic32/sdcard.img`
for imaging to an SD card, `sys/arch/pic32/compile/${BOARD}/unix`
ELF-formatted kernels, and `sys/arch/pic32/compile/${BOARD}/unix.hex`
Intel HEX-formatted kernels.

Put the generated file system image `sdcard.img` onto an SD card.

The `make` target `installfs` uses the `dd` utility to image the SD card
attached to the host operating system at `SDCARD`, such as `/dev/rsdXc` or
`/dev/sdX` or `/dev/rdiskX`, replacing `X` with the actual drive number or
letter, as the case may be.

For example, imaging an SD card attached at `sd2` on an OpenBSD host
operating system through the raw i/o device:

    $ make SDCARD=/dev/rsd2c installfs

Note that using BSD make on a FreeBSD host requires the system makefile
include directory to be specified on the command line or via the
`MAKESYSPATH` environment variable. For example:

    $ make -m /usr/share/mk

or

    $ MAKESYSPATH=/usr/share/mk
    $ export MAKESYSPATH

    $ make

Building a DiscoBSD Release
---------------------------

A DiscoBSD release consists of, for each supported architecture:

* a file system image that contains the full base system
* kernels, in various file formats, for each supported development board
* the README.md file for the architecture
* this README.md file

Before making a release, first create a distribution in `DESTDIR`
with kernels in `sys/arch/${MACHINE}/compile/${BOARD}` by following
the steps in [Building](#building):

    $ make distribution

Once all the distribution source objects exist then a release can
be created; one release for each architecture.

A DiscoBSD/stm32 release, as the default architecture, is created by:

    $ make release

A DiscoBSD/pic32 release is created by:

    $ make MACHINE=pic32 MACHINE_ARCH=mips release

A DiscoBSD release is created from an already-populated `DESTDIR`,
and it is placed in `RELEASEDIR`, `distrib/obj/releasedir` by default.

[Releases are available][11], for each architecture, as a `.tar.gz`
gzip-compressed tar archive and as a `.zip` zip-compressed archive.

Debugging
---------

DiscoBSD/stm32 is debugged through OpenOCD and GDB. The `make` targets for
debugging are `ocd` and `gdb-ocd`.

Debug a particular development board via:

    $ make BOARD=F412GDISCO ocd

in one terminal, and:

    $ make BOARD=F412GDISCO gdb-ocd

in another terminal.

Additional Information
----------------------

Port-specific information can be found in `distrib/${MACHINE}/README.md`
for [DiscoBSD/stm32][12] and [DiscoBSD/pic32][13].
